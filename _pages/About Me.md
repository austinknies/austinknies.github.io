Hi! My name is Austin Knies. I grew up in West Monroe, Louisiana, and I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Business Economics from Louisiana Tech University ('17). 

I am currently a fourth-year Economics Ph.D. student at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. My research interests are in applied microeconomics, specifically health economics, the economics of information, and networks. 

You can find more information about my research, past and present, under the [Research](/research/) section of this website. You can also [download my CV](/Austin_Knies_CV.pdf) for more details.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my wife Hannah, who currently teaches middle school English, and my dog Olan, who currently is asleep on the couch. 

I enjoy shooting hoops, hiking, running, rock climbing, traveling, and trying new foods. I'm a big fan of NBA basketball and root for the Indiana Pacers.

One exceptionally weird fact about me: when I was much younger and cooler, I spent time performing with a metalcore band called They Will Fall. While doing this, I also booked and promoted shows in the DIY music scene in north Louisiana. This role gave me the opportunity to travel and meet a lot of wonderful, interesting people, and so I really value and treasure the memories from this unique time in my life.
