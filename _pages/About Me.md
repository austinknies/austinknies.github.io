Welcome to my website! My name is Austin Knies. I am a Health Economics Senior Analyst at Abt Global, where my work on health care policy primarily involves Medicare and Medicaid model evaluation. Prior to joining Abt Global, I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics from Indiana University in the spring of 2024, where my research in applied microeconomics and health economics focused on the role of information constraints in health care choices. I have collaborated with scholars in economics, public policy, public health, and medicine on research ranging from improving health equity in maternal and child health to refining health care access and delivery for older adults. 

I grew up in West Monroe, Louisiana, and I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Business Economics from Louisiana Tech University in 2017.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my wife Hannah, who is a middle school Language Arts/STEAM teacher and fabrication lab facilitator, and my dog Olan, who is asleep on the couch. Along with being dog parents, we have also been foster parents and have worked with teenagers in foster care.

I enjoy shooting hoops, hiking, running, rock climbing, traveling, and trying new foods. I'm a big fan of professional basketball and root for the Indiana Pacers and Fever.

Prior to starting a Ph.D., I spent time performing, booking, and promoting shows in the DIY music scene in north Louisiana. Doing this for several years shaped who I am as a person in a variety of ways, and so I really treasure the memories from this part of my life.
