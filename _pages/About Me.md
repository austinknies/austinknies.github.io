Hi! My name is Austin Knies. I grew up in West Monroe, Louisiana, and I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Business Economics from Louisiana Tech University ('17). 

I am an Economics Ph.D. Candidate at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. My research interests are in applied microeconomics and specifically in health economics and information frictions. My work focuses on the role of information in health care in settings such as telehealth and telemedicine usage, price transparency regulation, and choice of insurance coverage.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my wife Hannah, who currently teaches middle school English, and my dog Olan, who currently is asleep on the couch. 

I enjoy shooting hoops, hiking, running, rock climbing, traveling, and trying new foods. I'm a big fan of NBA basketball and root for the Indiana Pacers.

A fun fact about me: prior to being a Ph.D. student, I spent time performing with a metalcore band called They Will Fall. While doing this, I also booked and promoted shows in the DIY music scene in north Louisiana. This role gave me the opportunity to travel and meet a lot of wonderful, interesting people, and so I really value and treasure the memories from this unique time in my life.
