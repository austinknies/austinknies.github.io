## Working Papers

- "Physician Information Costs and the Rise of Telehealth during the COVID-19 Pandemic" (Latest Draft: *March 2023*, Available Upon Request)

   **Abstract**: The use of synchronous telemedicine services rose dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, but to what extent should telehealth be used going forward? Using 2018-2022q1 claims data from Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics®️ Data Mart Database, I characterize the evolution of telehealth and face-to-face modalities for office and outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) service claims, where telehealth coding has been the most frequent. I find telehealth usage is associated with higher likelihood of patient mortality and ER visit within 6 months of E/M service claim, with strongest impact for Medicare Advantage plan members, for established patients, and for patients with no referring provider. To explain these findings, I model the physician-patient interaction as a costly information acquisition problem, where rationally inattentive physicians learn about the patient’s health status through costly signals. In doing so, I provide a mechanism to explain differences in health outcomes and quantify differences in information costs across visit modalities. Estimated average increases in physician information costs range between 5 to 37 percent with telehealth usage after March 2020. These findings reinforce existing literature that suggest telehealth is best used when expanding access to care for low-risk patients and as a complement rather than a substitute to in-person care.
