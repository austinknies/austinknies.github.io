<p> <small> My name is Austin Knies. In summer 2024, I will be joining Abt Global as a Health Economics Senior Analyst. I received a Ph.D. in Economics from Indiana University in the spring of 2024. My research interests are in applied microeconomics and specifically in health economics and information frictions. In my work, I've focused on the role of information in health care in settings such as telehealth and telemedicine usage, price transparency regulation, and choice of insurance coverage.  </small> </p>
