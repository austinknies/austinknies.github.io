<p> <small> Welcome to my website! My name is Austin Knies. I am a Health Economics Senior Analyst at Abt Global, where my work on health care policy primarily involves Medicare and Medicaid model evaluation. Prior to joining Abt Global, I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics from Indiana University in the spring of 2024, where my research in applied microeconomics and health economics focused on the role of information constraints in health care choices. I have collaborated with scholars in economics, public policy, public health, and medicine on research ranging from improving health equity in maternal and child health to refining health care access and delivery for older adults.  </small> </p>
